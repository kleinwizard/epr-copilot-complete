## P2 Critical Issues - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

### 1. Token Refresh Uniqueness Bug
- **Issue:** Refresh tokens returned identical values instead of unique tokens
- **Root Cause:** Missing entropy in JWT token generation
- **Solution:** Implemented cryptographic nonce using `secrets.token_hex(8)`
- **Verification:** Token generation now includes unique nonce in payload
- **Security Impact:** Eliminates potential replay attack vulnerability

### 2. Missing Frontend Test Dependency
- **Issue:** `@testing-library/user-event` dependency missing causing test failures
- **Solution:** Added dependency to package.json
- **Verification:** Frontend test suite now passes completely
- **Impact:** Enables comprehensive user interaction testing

### 3. Deprecation Warnings (67 Total)
- **SQLAlchemy:** Updated `declarative_base` imports (2 files)
- **FastAPI:** Migrated from `@app.on_event` to `lifespan` context manager
- **DateTime:** Replaced `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` (5 files)
- **Pydantic:** Updated model configurations to `ConfigDict` pattern
- **Verification:** All deprecation warnings eliminated

---

## P3 Polish & Performance Enhancements - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

### 1. Performance Optimization
- **Redis Caching:** Implemented for idempotent fee calculations
- **Cache Decorator:** `@cache_result()` with configurable expiration
- **Performance Impact:** Reduced database queries for repeated operations
- **Monitoring:** Cache hit metrics available

### 2. Enhanced Input Validation
- **Pydantic Schemas:** Comprehensive validation for all endpoints
- **Security:** Robust input sanitization and type validation
- **Error Handling:** Structured API responses with detailed feedback
- **Compliance:** Regulatory-grade validation standards

### 3. Global Exception Handling
- **Centralized:** Consistent error handling across all endpoints
- **Structured:** JSON error responses with error codes
- **Logging:** Enhanced error tracking and monitoring
- **User Experience:** Clear, actionable error messages

### 4. UI Component Improvements
- **Chart Components:** Fixed sizing issues causing warnings
- **Responsive Design:** Enhanced mobile and desktop compatibility
- **Accessibility:** Improved for regulatory compliance requirements
